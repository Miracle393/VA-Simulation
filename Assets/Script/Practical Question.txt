A is a solution of 3.80g/cm3 of HCL. B is a solution containing 1.2g per 250cm3 of XOH.
Put A into the burette and titrate it against 20 or 25 cm3 portions of B with A using methyl orange as the indicator.
Record the volume of your pipette. Tabulate your burette readings, and calculate the average volume of acid used from your results and the information provided.
Calculate:
a) The concentration of A in mol/dm3
b) The concentration of B in mol/dm3
c) Molar mass of XOH.
d) Relative atomic mass of X.
e) The mass of HCL in 20cm3 of solution.
